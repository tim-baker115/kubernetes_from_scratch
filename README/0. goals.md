# Goal

There will be a set of pods which will each have a predefined purpose. The ultimate goal is to use machine learning techniques (known ones, we're not breaking any new ground here!). To identify shares within the FTSE100 which should be bought, sold or held and to simulate that buy and ideally make a profit! I'll use tools I'm familiar with and ones I have an interest in to achive these goals.

I'll also use technologies which might not be necessary for a bit more expertise (e.g there's no benefit of installing itsio - but it looks cool).

Components and their purpose detailed below:

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
| --------- | ------- | ---|
| PosgresDB | Store stock exchange data | Requires persistent storage |
| Scraper | Retrieve FTSE data | Use yfinance initially |
| ML Model 1 | Linear regression | Python |
| ML Model 2 | XGBoost | Python |
| ML Model 3 | Black Scholes/GARCH | Python |
| Treasury | Simulates bank loans, considers risk and returns of the models | Â£100,000 limit |
| Prometheus | Graphing and trending | |
| Grafana | Cooler looking graphs | |
| ArgoCD | Simplification of the above | |
