## Workloads

The way in which a pod is deployed it known as it's workload in kubernetes land. Each workload provides a different set of charactersistics and jas a different yaml template, some examples below:

| Workload     | Purpose | DNS | IP | State | Example |
| ------------ | ------- | --- | -- | ----- | ------- |
| Deployment   | Runs stateless applications (e.g. NGINX web server) | Changes unless fronted by a Service | Changes | Lost on termination unless using a PersistentVolume | [deployment.yaml](../manifests/examples/workloads/deployment.yaml) |
| ReplicaSet   | Ensures a fixed number of identical Pods (usually managed by a Deployment) | Changes unless fronted by a Service | Changes | Lost unless a PersistentVolume is defined | [replicaset.yaml](../manifests/examples/workloads/replicaset.yaml) |
| StatefulSet  | Runs stateful applications with stable identity (e.g. databases) | Kept (per-Pod DNS via headless Service) | Kept | Kept (via PersistentVolumeClaim templates) | [statefulset.yaml](../manifests/examples/workloads/statefulset.yaml) |
| DaemonSet    | Runs a Pod on each (or selected) node (e.g. logging, monitoring agents, CNI plugins) | Changes unless fronted by a Service; per-Pod DNS possible via headless Service | Changes | Lost unless using node-local or network PersistentVolume | [daemonset.yaml](../manifests/examples/workloads/daemonset.yaml) |
| CronJob      | Runs Jobs on a time-based schedule (e.g. backups, batch tasks) | Changes | Changes | Lost unless a PersistentVolume is used | [cronjob.yaml](../manifests/examples/workloads/cronjob.yaml) |
| Job          | Runs Pods to completion (e.g. one-off tasks, data migrations) | Changes | Changes | Lost unless a PersistentVolume is used | [job.yaml](../manifests/examples/workloads/job.yaml) |

**Legend** 

- **DNS**: Whether the Pod(s) have a stable DNS name inside the cluster without needing a Service.  
- **IP**: Whether the Pod(s) keep the same cluster IP after restart/replacement.  
- **State**: Whether data is kept after Pod restart or rescheduling (requires PersistentVolumes for persistence).
