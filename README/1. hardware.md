| --------- | ------- |
| No computer (I use a laptop for work) | Buy a cheap laptop from ebay (recommend lenovo thinkcentre with a lot of memory). |

| No video          | I have faith the video works, but my TV was running at 4k... Find an alternateive monitor (my neighbors helped).   |
| USB stick didn't work/boot          | The [automated cloudinit stuff](https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howto/autoinstall-quickstart.html) I'd googled didn't work with the uefi boot... Back to square one.        |
| Need a keyboard now | Buy a keyboard (a cheap one).        |
| USB stick still doesn't work          | Let's go back to the basics, use the basic ubuntu server image.        |
