# Kubernetes from scratch
The aim of this repo will be to document my progress learning kubernetes.
* It will break down each of the challenges I've faced with a set of readme's (with no exceptions).
* It will also contain code relevant to the process as I progress.
* It will contain text snippets I've used to simplify my problems.
* It should focus as both a reflective piece and a progressive piece which meets the goals defined in step 0!
